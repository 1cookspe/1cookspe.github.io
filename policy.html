This information is non-invasive, and is only collected to better understand the demographics and preferences of the users of String Chooser. These findings are also basic, and are in no way tied to you as a person; they are only displayed in a broad report that describes the types of users on stringchooser.com. Google Analytics is deployed on most websites simply for the purpose of gauging the general sector of String Chooser's users, to build a better experience to fit their needs or tendencies.
