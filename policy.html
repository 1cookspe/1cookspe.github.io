		<p class="answerPolicy">String Chooser would like to thank you for using our service to find the perfect tennis strings for your game. String Chooser's primary and sole purpose is to determine the optimal tennis strings that would complement your playing style.</p>

		<h3 class="titlePolicy">What Information String Chooser Collects and Why</h3>
		<p class="answerPolicy">String Chooser collects basic information from your website browser through Google Analytics about your general behavior on the site, including the country you are browsing from, the website that referred you to stringchooser.com, and the general time of your visit. This information is non-invasive, and is only collected to better understand the demographics and preferences of the users of String Chooser. These findings are also basic, and are in no way tied to you as a person; they are only displayed in a broad report that describes the types of users on stringchooser.com. Google Analytics is deployed on most websites simply for the purpose of gauging the general sector of String Chooser's users, to build a better experience to fit their needs or tendencies.</p>
		<p class="answerPolicy">Google Adsense is used for the purpose of delivering advertisements that are relevant to the user's interests. Google uses your previous browsing tendencies to show you ads that would appeal to your interests. Once again, we at String Chooser do not even see this information, as it is protected entirely by Google.</p>
		<p class="answerPolicy">For more information on Google's policy regarding their services, please check out <a class="policyLink" target="_blank" href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">HOW GOOGLE USES INFORMATION FROM SITES OR APPS THAT USE OUR SERVICES</a>.</p>
		<p class="answerPolicy">String Chooser uses local storage simply to store if you have agreed to this privacy/cookie policy. No information is collected about you, as the website just simply stores a variable in your web browser's storage about your agreement with the policy.</p>
		<p class="answerPolicy">In summary, String Chooser only collects basic, general information to produce an analytical representation of the activity on the website and deliver a fresh experience to users that is not redundant with irrelevant information.</p>

		<h3 class="titlePolicy">What Information String Chooser Does NOT Collect</h3>
		<p class="answerPolicy">String Chooser does NOT collect any sensitive, personal data about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. String Chooser has no intention of trying to collect or steal information from you for the company's own personal gain. Simply put, the only information that String Chooser collects from you as a person is a general idea of your tennis playing style, obtained from the 7 survey questions, which is only computed once to determine optimal tennis strings for your performance, and is erased once the string results are displayed.</p>

		<h3 class="titlePolicy">Use of Cookies</h3>
		<p class="answerPolicy">String Chooser only uses minimal cookies to deliver basic functionality of the website.

		<p class="answerPolicy">Google Adsense uses cookies to improve the relevancy of the advertisements you see. The cookies are used to determine what types of advertisements would suit your interests.
